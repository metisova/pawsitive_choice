# Pawsitive Choice

The Pawsitive Choice app is a web application created as the final project of the Czechitas Web Academy 2023. It aims to increase awareness about animal testing in the beauty and cosmetics industry. The app allows users to scan product barcodes and determine if the brand carries out animal testing for its products. It provides information about the brand, such as its name, country of origin, and cruelty-free status.

## Features

- Barcode Scanning and Manual Entry: Users can either scan product barcodes using their device's camera or enter them manually to retrieve information about the brand's animal testing practices.
- Brand Information: The app displays brand information, including the brand name, country, and whether it is cruelty-free.
- External Links: Users can find more information about a brand by clicking on an external link that redirects to the brand's website.
- Dark Mode: The app includes a dark mode feature that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.

## Target Audience

The Pawsitive Choice app is primarily designed for mobile users, as its scanning abilities are limited by the quality of the device's camera. 

## Technologies Used

The Pawsitive Choice app is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A library for routing and navigation within the React application.
- React Context: Used to manage the dark mode state across components.
- React-zxing: A library for barcode scanning using the ZXing library.
- CSS: Used for styling the components and layout of the app.

## Known Issues

- The app utilizes an API that is currently in a free trial period. During this trial, it allows only 50 requests, and the access will expire on July 1, 2023. To continue using the app beyond that date, either a paid subscription or a custom database will be required.

- There may be issues with scanning from a desktop environment depending on the the quality of the device's camera.

## Data Source

This project uses data from a custom JSON database that contains information about more than 90 brands and their cruelty-free status.
